== 1.0.1 / 2010-01-21

   * Fixed warnings

== 0.11.0 / 2009-08-04

   * Removed useless files 
   * Corrected version number 

== 1.0.1 / 2011-02-09

   * Added ability to specify file format in Ruby with Range class (see example.rb in /test.)
   
== 1.2.6

   * NHGIS had been using this version for a long time until the Ruby 1.9 conversion
     and the related work to get character-encoding to function properly.

== 1.4.0

   * support for Ruby 1.9 character encoding
   * Note: I saw that Colin had a series of 1.3 "releases" on his computer, but apparently
     not released anywhere; so I jumped ahead in the version numbering to 1.4
   * Deal with Latin-1 character encoding when using String#pack, force to Latin-1 since
     that's the only encoding that makes sense for fixed width files (one byte per char).

== 1.4.1

   * conditionally use force_encoding, if method available


== 1.5.1

  * Add set_random() and get_random_record(record_number) for random access mode. See examples.rb in test directory for example code.
